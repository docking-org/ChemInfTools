# Matthew Smith, 12/5/19

# Shoichet Lab: Torsion Strain Rotation Project
# This Python script will contain all of the functions for using the Torsion
# Library method for estimating torsion strain energy. To use these functions,
# source this script in either another Python script or a Python commandline
# session as:
#   exec(open("TL_Functions.py").read())
# when in the same directory.

# We will use TL_2.1_VERSION_6.xml as the Torsion Library.

# Explanation of how this works from TL_Lookup_Test.py:
# Since the Torsion Library contains very specific SMARTS patterns to define
# the torsion patterns (also called torsion rules in the acutal library) and
# there are only 514 torsion patterns in TL_2.1, it is best to just search
# over all of the torsion rules in the library, instead of trying to find
# and classify every substructure in the molecule. This was Ying's suggestion.
# For each torsion rule, we will use the GetSubstructMatches function in
# the package rdkit.Chem to find the indeces of the atoms that match the
# torsion rule. If there are multiple such substructures, then this function
# should return multiple sets of indeces. We will then find the information
# we need (dihedral angle, method, estimate, lower bound, upper bound, and
# flag). Since the same torsion pattern in the molecule can have multiple
# torsion rules in the library applying to it, we need to choose the intended
# torsion rule. The authors of the original Torsion Library ordered the
# torsion rules within each subclass in decreasing specificity, so we will
# keep track of the number of the torsion rule for each matching substructure.
# We will then pick the set of information with the lowest counting index,
# assuming that this is the most specific. Since the first hierarchy class in
# the Torsion Library is the general class, we will need to loop over all of
# the specific classes first. This process is not the most efficient, since
# we are looking up and calculating information that we immediately throw away,
# but we can optimize this procedure later.

# Once we have one set of information for each set of indeces defining the
# bonds, we need to condense these by torsion pattern. We must do this because,
# for a given bond, each atom can be bonded to 2 or 3 other atoms in a torsion
# pattern. This gives between 2*2=4 and 3*3=9 possible lists of 4 atom indeces
# defining the torsion pattern, not including reversing the order of the
# indeces! Therefore we need to find all of the information sets (angle,
# estimate, etc.) with the same atom indeces defining the bond (listed
# forwards and backwards) and decide which one we will keep. Since we are
# using these energy estimates for identifying unstable conformations in
# DOCK-ing campaigns, being conservstive with our hit-picking means being
# liberal in our energy assignments. We thus keep the set of information with
# the highest energy estimate, prioritizing the estimates from specific
# hierarchy classes over ones from the general hierarchy class.
